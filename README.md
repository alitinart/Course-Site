<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This started as a challenge I made to myself when I learned React.JS.
Create a website where people can learn to code from videos that I post. This turned out
pretty well.
The code can be optimized a lot and I am working on that.
Mabye some day it will become a real project where people can actually learn ðŸ‘€.

Everything works all it needs is actual content.
